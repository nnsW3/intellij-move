# INTELLIJ MOVE CHANGELOG: 1.28.0

12 May 2023

## Features

* Add "Run Transaction" and "View" run configurations. 

* Rewrite type inference algorithm to make it linear, add type inference to many more cases.

* Remove outer parentheses in "Remove redundant cast" fix.

## Fixes

* Lots of fixes for the Move Specification Language. 

## Other

* Now there's two modes in the IDE: "user mode" and "debug mode". In "user mode" (default) many fallbacks are enabled to prevent
crashing the plugin, and avoid false-positive errors. "debug mode" is enabled from the plugin settings and 
eases bug reports.
